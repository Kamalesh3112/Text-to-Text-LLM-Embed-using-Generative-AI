# Text prompt to Text output Language Model using Generative Foundation AI
> This is an small language model with minimal parameters and tokens as specifically developed for accepting the prompt as the input text. And generating output in the form of text by answering the question prompts correctly.

This language model essentially used with 50 tokens and limited context windows for to use only specific parameters of input text. As a external integration, I used the API of already pretrained Large Language Model called as Embed that is developed by Cohere. By using API in my own LM, I can able to access the advantages of the Embed model in my code window. Cohere Embed Language Model is an text representation model that can be used with Large Language Model for semantic search applications.

## Steps undergone to develop the LML
- Using the text data and feeding it into the model.
- Building the Language Model with certain conditions and limitation in the performance.
- Performing tokenization step to minimize the size of text into the form of Tokens.
- Saving the tokens (small chunks) in the vector database of the model using Embedding and Indexing to exhibit Semantic Search for the LM to search an required element in the vector database.
- Training and building the prompt for the model based on the input data.
- Testing the model with respect to the responses.
- Language Model is tested and ready to use.

  > This is an small Language Model that is designed specifically to accept an input in the form of text and generate response through text. The main objective of this model to perform task specific operations like generating responses only based on input text data that is given. It cannot able to think out of the text data.
